# gptchatbot_with_langchain
ChatGPT 3.5 Bot integrated with LangChain. Deployed to AWS Beanstalk.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service.
Click on "Create a new environment", and then select "Web server environment".
Choose a preconfigured platform that matches your app's requirements. For example, if you're using Python, choose "Python" as the platform and select the appropriate version.
Configure your environment by giving it a name, choosing a domain, and selecting the appropriate instance type and security groups.
Upload your code to Elastic Beanstalk. You can either upload a ZIP file or connect to a Git repository.
Configure your environment variables by clicking on "Configuration", then "Software", and then "Environment properties". Here, you can set any necessary environment variables for your app, such as API keys or database connection strings.
Save your changes and deploy your app by clicking on "Create environment".
Once your app is deployed, Elastic Beanstalk will provide you with a URL where you can access your app.
Optional: Set up a custom domain name for your app by following the instructions in the Elastic Beanstalk documentation.

That's it! Your Streamlit app is now deployed and running on AWS. Note that Elastic Beanstalk will automatically handle scaling, load balancing, and other infrastructure concerns for you, so you can focus on developing your app.
